# World Happiness Report Analysis
## Project Summary

Since 2012, the World Happiness Report has published a report that contains articles and rankings of national happiness based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report correlates with various factors to create a Happiness Score.
This repository contains exploritory analysis using techniques like pair plots and and correlation heat plots to uncover relationships between the variables. Linear regression models were used to test hypothesis and test the rigor of the variable relationships. Unsupervised Machine learning in the form of cluster analysis was used to examine further insights into the data.

## Key Questions & Objectives

Questions That I was looking to answer:

    What were the main variables that contribute to Happiness?
    Did these variables change globaly?
    What is percieved as imortant to happiness and do these values change from country to country?
  
## Data & Tools

The data set includes information about year, country name, country rank, GDP per Capita, , happiness score, , social support, life expectancy, freedom of choice, generocity and percieved corruption. 
The data was taken from the World Happiness Reports 2015-2024

### The data was analysed using Python and the following libraries:

  - Pandas: for data analysis
  - Numpy: for mathematical equations
  - Seaborn: for data visualizations
  - Matplotlib: for data visualizations
  - SciPy: for mathematical equations
  - Scikit-learn: for implementing regression models and clustering algorithms
  - Visualisations and Storyboard were created using Tableau
